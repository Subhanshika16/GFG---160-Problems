# 🚀GFG-160-Problems
Welcome to my repository documenting the 160-Day GeeksforGeeks DSA Problem-Solving Challenge!
This repo is a structured collection of solutions to Data Structures & Algorithms problems, aimed at building a strong foundation in problem-solving, coding efficiency, and interview preparation.
# ✨ Consistency beats intensity — One problem at a time, one day at a time. 
# 📌 About the Challenge
The 160-Day GFG Challenge is designed to cover essential DSA concepts step by step.
It focuses on problem-solving across topics like arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

# Goal with this repo is to:

- ✅ Build strong problem-solving skills

- ✅ Track my progress in DSA consistently

- ✅ Provide clean, well-documented solutions for reference

- ✅ Help others who are on a similar journey

# ⚡ Languages & Tools Used

- C++ / Python for solutions
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook for coding & debugging
- GitHub for version control & progress tracking

# 🌟 Key Learnings
Throughout this challenge, I am gaining:
- Deep understanding of time & space complexity
- Confidence in solving interview-level coding problems
- Consistency in coding practice
- Hands-on implementation of major DSA topics
